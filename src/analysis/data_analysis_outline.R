### Step 1: Split Data into Training, Validation, Testing Sets ###

#Q: do we have enough data to do this?

### Step 2: Define All Variables to Use in Model and Appropriate Model ###

#Q: I think there are standard statistical tests that help you pick the right model (eg Poison, linear, etc.)
# Use training data to identify good model 

### Step 3: Use Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Forward Selection to Identify Subset of Variables ###

#Q: we'd have to rewrite code for forward selection

### Step 3a:Lasso

### Step 3b: Ridge

### Step 3c: Elastic Net

### Step 3d: Forward Selection


### Step 4: Assess Model on Test Set ###

### Step 4a: Assess accuracy in terms of minimizing RMSE

### Step 4b: Calculate 90% quantile

### Step 4c: Calculate prediction interval and discuss width

### Step 4d: Assess coverage of prediction interval on test set


### Step 5: Local Hypothesis Testing ###

#Q: Not splitting data
### 5a: fit final model on each local hypothesis (each block group = one hypothesis)

### 5b: use false discovery
